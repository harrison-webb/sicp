 Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is
 using applicative order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

 '''
 (define (p) (p))
 (define (text x y)
    (if (= x 0) 0 y))
'''

Then he evaluates the expression

'''
(test 0 (p))
'''

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation?
What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation?
Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether
the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: predicate expression is evaluated first,
and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)


Applicative-order:
The procedure will go straight to the if statement, evaluate that x is indeed zero, and return 0.

Normal-order:
The procedure will attempt to expand itself fully before evaluating, so it will get stuck in an infinite loop of p -> p -> p ... because p has a circular definition.
The expression sequence would look like:
(test 0 (p)) -> evaluate (p) to (p) â†´
(test 0 (p)) -> evaluate (p) to (p), etc etc etc
