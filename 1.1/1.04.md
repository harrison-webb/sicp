Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

'''
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
'''

The if operator is choosing what operation will be used on a and b depending on the sign of b.
If b > 0, the procedure will return (a + b). If b <= 0, the procedure will return (a - b) (which returns a value >= a. [2-(-1) -> 2+1])
